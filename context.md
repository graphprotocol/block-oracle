# Context for CorrectLastEpoch Implementation

## Current Situation
- An incorrect block number was posted for a specific chain in the current epoch
- Need to implement a correction mechanism quickly
- Full CorrectEpochs (for historical corrections) is too complex for immediate needs

## Key Technical Context

### How the Oracle Works
1. **Data Flow**: Oracle collects BlockPtr (number + hash) ‚Üí compresses to accelerations/deltas ‚Üí sends merkle root + accelerations on-chain
2. **Block hashes are NEVER sent on-chain** - only merkle roots and accelerations
3. **Subgraph reconstructs block numbers** from accelerations using: `blockNumber[N] = blockNumber[N-1] + delta[N]`

### Why CorrectLastEpoch is Simpler
- No cascade updates needed (it's the last epoch, no subsequent epochs exist)
- No complex delta recalculation for future epochs
- Single network correction per message keeps it atomic

### Implementation Approach
- Implementing CorrectLastEpoch first (simple, immediate need)
- CorrectEpochs documented in docs/future_work/ for later
- Using message type 7 (need to update default case to 8)

### Key Design Decisions Made
1. **One network per message** - simpler than BTreeMap
2. **Don't modify original SetBlockNumbersForEpochMessage** - preserve for audit trail
3. **Include new merkle root** - for offchain verification
4. **CLI with --dry-run and confirmation prompt** - safety first
5. **Keep merkle root instead of just block hash** - ensures complete verifiability even if original data was garbage

### Technical Gotchas
- Network IDs in subgraph are strings ("0", "1"), not u64
- StoreCache needs explicit save() calls
- Merkle root computation needs ALL networks' data, not just the corrected one

### What's in TODO.md
- Complete implementation plan for CorrectLastEpoch
- All code snippets and structure
- Testing strategy
- CLI design with safety features

### What's NOT in TODO.md but Important
- The protocol now runs on Arbitrum One (not Ethereum)
- Epochs are 7200 blocks (24 hours)
- This is implementing part of GIP-0038
- The immediate problem: wrong block posted for current epoch
- Original incorrect block data might be garbage/unobtainable

### Current Progress (Latest Update)

**Status: 95% Complete** üéØ

### ‚úÖ Completed Items
1. **Rust Implementation** - Message definition, serialization, and comprehensive tests
2. **JSON Encoder** - Full support with validation and error handling
3. **Subgraph Schema** - Complete with CorrectLastEpochMessage and LastEpochCorrection entities
4. **Subgraph Handler** - Fully implemented with proper validation and error handling
5. **CAIP-2 Migration** - Changed from numeric network IDs to chain ID strings (e.g., "eip155:42161")
6. **Permission System** - Updated production and test configs to allow CorrectLastEpoch
7. **Comprehensive Testing** - All subgraph tests passing with proper edge case coverage
8. **Repository Cleanup** - Fixed .gitignore, removed constants.ts from tracking
9. **Code Quality** - All Rust code formatted, linted, and tested

### üîÑ Currently Working On
1. **CLI Command** - Adding `correct-last-epoch` subcommand to block-oracle binary (90% complete)

### üéØ Key Changes from Original Plan
- **Simplified CLI**: Direct parameter input rather than automatic querying/computation
- **Fixed Network Validation**: Using `cache.isNetworkAlreadyRegistered()` for proper validation
- **VarInt Encoding**: Using Rust encoder for all tests to avoid manual encoding errors
- **Constants Management**: Discovered constants.ts is generated from templates, not committed

### Major Lessons Learned
1. **AssemblyScript Quirks**: Need explicit `!` operator for nullable types
2. **Network Validation**: Use existing cache methods rather than manual entity checks
3. **Subgraph Testing**: Must be run manually by user due to TTY requirements
4. **Configuration Management**: Permission system uses mustache templates from config files
5. **VarInt Encoding**: Manual encoding error-prone, always use Rust encoder
6. **Git Tracking**: Generated files (constants.ts) should not be committed

## Next Steps When Resuming
1. **Finish CLI Command** - Complete the `correct_last_epoch` function implementation
2. **Test CLI Command** - Build and test the new command
3. **Documentation** - Update CLAUDE.md with final usage instructions

### Current CLI Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Added CorrectLastEpoch variant to Clap enum with proper arguments
- ‚úÖ Added match case in main() function
- üîÑ Implementing `correct_last_epoch()` function
- ‚è≥ Need to fix import issues (messages_to_encoded_message_blocks is private)
