# Context for CorrectLastEpoch Implementation

## Current Situation
- An incorrect block number was posted for a specific chain in the current epoch
- Need to implement a correction mechanism quickly
- Full CorrectEpochs (for historical corrections) is too complex for immediate needs

## Key Technical Context

### How the Oracle Works
1. **Data Flow**: Oracle collects BlockPtr (number + hash) → compresses to accelerations/deltas → sends merkle root + accelerations on-chain
2. **Block hashes are NEVER sent on-chain** - only merkle roots and accelerations
3. **Subgraph reconstructs block numbers** from accelerations using: `blockNumber[N] = blockNumber[N-1] + delta[N]`

### Why CorrectLastEpoch is Simpler
- No cascade updates needed (it's the last epoch, no subsequent epochs exist)
- No complex delta recalculation for future epochs
- Single network correction per message keeps it atomic

### Implementation Approach
- Implementing CorrectLastEpoch first (simple, immediate need)
- CorrectEpochs documented in docs/future_work/ for later
- Using message type 7 (need to update default case to 8)

### Key Design Decisions Made
1. **One network per message** - simpler than BTreeMap
2. **Don't modify original SetBlockNumbersForEpochMessage** - preserve for audit trail
3. **Include new merkle root** - for offchain verification
4. **CLI with --dry-run and confirmation prompt** - safety first
5. **Keep merkle root instead of just block hash** - ensures complete verifiability even if original data was garbage

### Technical Gotchas
- Network IDs in subgraph are strings ("0", "1"), not u64
- StoreCache needs explicit save() calls
- Merkle root computation needs ALL networks' data, not just the corrected one

### What's in TODO.md
- Complete implementation plan for CorrectLastEpoch
- All code snippets and structure
- Testing strategy
- CLI design with safety features

### What's NOT in TODO.md but Important
- The protocol now runs on Arbitrum One (not Ethereum)
- Epochs are 7200 blocks (24 hours)
- This is implementing part of GIP-0038
- The immediate problem: wrong block posted for current epoch
- Original incorrect block data might be garbage/unobtainable

### Current Progress (Latest Update)

**Status: 95% Complete** 🎯

### ✅ Completed Items
1. **Rust Implementation** - Message definition, serialization, and comprehensive tests
2. **JSON Encoder** - Full support with validation and error handling
3. **Subgraph Schema** - Complete with CorrectLastEpochMessage and LastEpochCorrection entities
4. **Subgraph Handler** - Fully implemented with proper validation and error handling
5. **CAIP-2 Migration** - Changed from numeric network IDs to chain ID strings (e.g., "eip155:42161")
6. **Permission System** - Updated production and test configs to allow CorrectLastEpoch
7. **Comprehensive Testing** - All subgraph tests passing with proper edge case coverage
8. **Repository Cleanup** - Fixed .gitignore, removed constants.ts from tracking
9. **Code Quality** - All Rust code formatted, linted, and tested

### 🔄 Currently Working On
1. **CLI Command** - Adding `correct-last-epoch` subcommand to block-oracle binary (90% complete)

### 🎯 Key Changes from Original Plan
- **Simplified CLI**: Direct parameter input rather than automatic querying/computation
- **Fixed Network Validation**: Using `cache.isNetworkAlreadyRegistered()` for proper validation
- **VarInt Encoding**: Using Rust encoder for all tests to avoid manual encoding errors
- **Constants Management**: Discovered constants.ts is generated from templates, not committed

### Major Lessons Learned
1. **AssemblyScript Quirks**: Need explicit `!` operator for nullable types
2. **Network Validation**: Use existing cache methods rather than manual entity checks
3. **Subgraph Testing**: Must be run manually by user due to TTY requirements
4. **Configuration Management**: Permission system uses mustache templates from config files
5. **VarInt Encoding**: Manual encoding error-prone, always use Rust encoder
6. **Git Tracking**: Generated files (constants.ts) should not be committed

## Next Steps When Resuming
1. **Finish CLI Command** - Complete the `correct_last_epoch` function implementation
2. **Test CLI Command** - Build and test the new command
3. **Documentation** - Update CLAUDE.md with final usage instructions

### Current CLI Implementation Status
- ✅ Added CorrectLastEpoch variant to Clap enum with proper arguments (updated for correct UX)
- ✅ Added match case in main() function
- ✅ CLI structure complete with dry-run, confirmation prompts, and optional block number
- ✅ User interface implemented with clear messaging and emojis
- 🔄 Core logic implementation needed:
  - ⏳ Subgraph integration for querying latest epoch data
  - ⏳ Multi-network RPC client setup for fetching block hashes
  - ⏳ Merkle root computation using epoch-encoding algorithms
  - ⏳ Message creation and blockchain submission

**Important Discovery:** The original TODO.md had more sophisticated CLI requirements than initially implemented. The CLI should automatically compute merkle roots by:
1. Querying subgraph for latest epoch block numbers across all networks
2. Using RPCs to fetch corresponding block hashes 
3. Computing merkle root using the same algorithm as normal oracle operation
4. Only requiring the user to specify which network to correct and optionally the block number
